bzsh is a better zsh.

# about
yes i know this is another plugin manager and i have to make something so this is what i wanted to make.


# plugins
bzsh comes with NO plugins. if you want plugins you have to install them. i did this so its not bloated.


# install 

``` sh
sh <(curl -v -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hexisXz/bzsh/main/install)
```
